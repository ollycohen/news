For our creative portion we:
* implemented a liking feature using a new database table. articles can be liked and unliked, and total likes are shown. A user can only add a single like at a time to an article (no duplicates in the database), and the like/unlike button changes per article per user.
* we added timestamps for articles and comments, which update when they are edited.
* we improved the accessibility and design of the site with bootstrap features and highlighting the username of an article if authored by user logged in.
